# 🎯 Elective Exchange – Profile-First Matching

A smart, student-first platform that helps you **swap electives seamlessly**.
No clutter. No waiting. Just **perfect 2-way matches**.

---

## 🌟 How It Works

### **Step 1: Profile Setup**

Set up your profile once and let the system do the work:

* **Enter your details**: Name, enrollment, phone, email
* **Current elective**: The subject you already have
* **Wanted electives**: Add multiple subjects you’d like to switch into
* **Priority ordering**: Drag and drop to reorder your preferences

  * 🥇 **#1 (Gold)** – Highest priority
  * 🥈 **#2 (Blue)** – Second priority
  * 🥉 **#3 (Purple)** – Third priority
  * …and so on

---

### **Step 2: Browse Perfect Matches**

Once your profile is ready, you’ll only see **students who are a 2-way fit**:

1. They have one of **your wanted electives**
2. They want **your current elective**

💡 **Sorted by your priorities** – students with your #1 wanted elective appear first!

✅ **Contact details shown instantly** (phone & email)
✅ **One-click contact tracking** – mark who you’ve already reached out to

---

Would you like me to make this **student-facing** (simple and casual, like an onboarding guide) or **developer-facing** (setup instructions, code usage, stack details)?
