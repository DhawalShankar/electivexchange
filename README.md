# **Elective Exchange — By a JIIT Student, For JIIT Students**

Elective registration at JIIT often becomes chaotic — scattered WhatsApp messages, last-minute panic, and endless scrolling.
**Elective Exchange** is my small effort to bring clarity and calm to this process.

Built with care for my own campus community, this platform helps students find **perfect 2-way elective swap matches** with zero noise and zero confusion.

## ⭐ **Why I Built This**

Every semester I saw friends stressed, running around, trying to swap subjects.
I wanted to create something simple, elegant, and genuinely useful — something that respects everyone's time.

So I built a system where:

* You set your preferences once
* The platform does the matching
* And you instantly see the right people to contact

A small contribution, but made with sincerity.
